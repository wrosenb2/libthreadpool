# libthreadpool
Compact C library for easily implementing thread-pools using the native pthread API on POSIX systems. I personally do not consider this project ready for release. It has not been thoroughly tested and there is no documentation or configure script, but it works on Linux and OS X as far as I know so use it if you want.
